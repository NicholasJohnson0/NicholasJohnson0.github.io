This is the progress that I have made so far. I have implemented some of the main
features

Features Implemented - 
- Home page
- Header
- Footer
- Styling using Custom and Bootstrap CSS

I plan on implementing some little projects in the projects tab dropdown bar that can
be clicked on and take you to new webpages. I also am probably going to make the
header and footer into their own files in the snippets folder so that I can easily
use those when making new pages. I also plan on fixing the home page and adding
links to my linkedin, github, and other related sites.
